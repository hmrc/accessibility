# Issue: Error summary contains invalid links [draft]

Links within the error summary either do not work or link to the wrong destination.

The value in the `href` does not match the corresponding `id` of the control that contains the error.

This could either be an invalid `id`, one that does not exist, or an `id` that links to another part of the page, for example linking to a fieldset that contains a set of radio buttons.

The user is unable to quickly navigate to every issue and has to look through the whole page and indentify which issue relates to the broken link.

## To resolve:

Ensure you are linking to the correct answer by following the GOV.UK pattern - [Linking from the error summary to each answer](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary#linking-from-the-error-summary-to-each-answer).
