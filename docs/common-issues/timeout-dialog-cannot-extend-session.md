# Issue: Timeout dialog - cannot extend session

While the service has a timeout dialog and it is presented correctly, the user's session is being lost.

This can be for a number of reasons:

- the endpoint is not triggering a renewed session either in the frontend or in the database
- the service is timing out due to the user being passed temporarily to another service where the user spends longer than the originator service's timeout period

Being able to extend a session is critical in allowing users the time they need to work through a service and complete tasks without losing data.

People with disabilities such as blindness, low vision, dexterity impairments or cognitive impairments may require more time to read content or to complete a task like filling in a form.
