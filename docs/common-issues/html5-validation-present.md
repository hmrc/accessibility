# Issue: HTML5 form field validation present

HTML5 validation is triggered when certain attributes are added to form controls, such as `pattern`, `required` and certain `type` values.

There are a few reasons why HTML5 validation is not desirable as an out-of-the-box solution:

- the style of the errors does not match the other error styles in the pattern library
- the error message is temporary, disappearing when focus is moved
- when used on a field with an `autocomplete` attribute, the error is obscured by the autocomplete options
- it doesn't pull attention so can be missed
- only one error is shown at a time, so a user may have to repeatedly submit the form to fix all the issues
- doesn't respond to font size zoom
- the error messages are not especially helpful

## To resolve

Add a `novalidate` attribute to the `form` element to prevent HTML5 validation.
