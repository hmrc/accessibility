# VoiceOver on iOS
Voiceover is a free screen-reader built into iOS.
Whilst it shares much functionality with Voiceover for Mac OS, the mechanisms for using it are very different and it's support for various accessibility features are different to the Mac OS version.

## System set-up
Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOVer

## Testing notes
Use Safari browser
There are two ways of accessing pages with Voiceover on iOS, swiping (to access items consecutively) and by dragging a finger across the screen to have whatever is under the finger read out. You should test using the former.
