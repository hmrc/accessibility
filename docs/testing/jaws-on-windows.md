# JAWS on Windows
JAWS is a commerical screen-reader available on Windows only. It is expensive but full-featured and is one of the most popular screen-readers.

You can access a time-linited trial which works for 40 minutes after which you will need to reboot to start the timer again.

Fully licensed installs are available to use on the HMRC accessibility lab laptops.

## System set-up
Using JAWS 2018, 2019 or 2020. Use more than one version if possible as there are differences in how JAWS 2018 vs JAWS 2020 perform, for example.

Avoid changing any settings beyond the modifier keys. Because users can modify their set-up in many different ways it is best to test with the default settings. This also makes it easier to replicate issues.

## Testing notes
Using IE11 and Chrome.

## What to look for
Perform [common screen-reader checks](common/screen-readers.md).
