# How to test for accessibility

## Testing tasks
These are tasks you can undertake to test your service for accessibility. Some of these will reference the [common testing methods](#common-testing-methods).
As a bare minimun we suggest you perform the generic tasks along with at least one screen-reader.

### Generic
- [code quality](testing/code-quality.md)
- [usability and performance](testing/usability-and-performance.md)
- [keyboard only](testing/keyboard-only.md)
- [increased font size on mobile and desktop](testing/font-size.md)
- [native page zoom](testing/native-page-zoom.md)
- [content](testing/content.md)
- [colour](testing/colour.md)

### Windows

## Common testing methods
There are certain things which you will want to look for regardless of which assistive technology you are using - there are certain aspects which are common to all screen-reader technology for example. These general principles are covered in this section.

- [screen magnification](testing/common/screen-magnification.md)
- [larger text and increased spacing](testing/common/font.md)
- [screen-readers](testing/common/screen-readers.md)
- [voice command and voice-to-text](testing/common/voice.md)
