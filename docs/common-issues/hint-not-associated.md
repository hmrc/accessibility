# Issue: Hint not associated with input

Hint copy is present for the form control but it is not programmatically associated with it.

This means that a screen-reader user who is navigating by form fields, or who moves directly to a field from an error summary link, will not hear the hint copy.

## To resolve

The hint copy should have a unique `id` attribute added.

For single inputs the hint can be associated adding an `aria-describedby` attribute on the `input` itself, with the hint `id` as the value.

For grouped fields where the hint refers to all the fields, the `aria-describedby` can be placed on the `fieldset`.

The `aria-describedby` attribute can take multiple `id` references as the value with spaces between.

The order of the `id` in the value will determine the order the content is read out by the screen-reader, so it should be in the same order as the content is on screen - typically the hint first, then the error message when present.

Content referenced by `aria-describedby` should be simple text with no nested elements (such as lists) as screen-readers will not always read out complex content in full.
