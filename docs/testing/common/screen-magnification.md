# Testing for screen magnification
These are tasks to be completed using screen magnification software.

- where pages change layout (for example where most pages donâ€™t use a sidebar, but the odd one does as this suggests a learned pattern which is then broken)
- pages which have related content remote from each other without any indicator to tie them together (for example a Check Your Answer page is missing the line under each row)
- hover states which cover information or which contain information that cannot be read in full without moving off the trigger area
- complete the user journey using the screen magnifier only
