# Check the accessibility of your service before you get an audit

The accessibility of your service is your team’s responsibility.

Before you have an in-house accessibility audit or a formal external audit by Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC), you should check the accessibility of your service.

To help you we’ve listed some things you can check for throughout development.

As an absolute bare minimum, we recommend following these three tasks:

1. Make sure each page contains valid HTML.
2. Make sure each page is free from WCAG errors.
3. Test each page with a screen reader.

Carrying out these checks will help you:

- improve the accessibility of your service
- save time by eliminating issues early
- make sure it meets
 the [public sector accessibility regulations](regulations-to-make-public-sector-websites-and-mobile-applications-accessible.md)

## When should you consider accessibility

Accessibility is a user need. You should be thinking about the access needs of your users from the start of design, research and development. Do not leave it until the end.

Build accessibility tasks into each sprint and include them in your workflow. Here are some examples that you can use.

- [Definition of Ready](definition-of-ready.md)
- [Definition of Done](definition-of-done.md)

## Accessibility quick wins

​Ideally you should test your service regularly in the accessibility lab, using a range of devices. This will get you a long way towards avoiding the most common accessibility failings.

## Design and usability quick wins

Avoid the most common GOV.UK Design System and usability issues that we see when auditing services.

## Make use of automated helpers

We recommend that you share the load between all team members so that everybody owns at least one accessibility task.

- [Stage three: Continuous Integration tools](stage-three--ci-tools.md)
