# Testing with voice
These are tasks to be completed when using voice command software.

- check all links, buttons and inputs can be accessed directly. Where possible this should be done via a unique name. Where this is not possible (for example a check your answers page with multiple 'change' links) saying the visible name should provide the user with numbered options to select from. Using the grid overlay should be a last resort and if required will need additional investigation.
- check all inputs can be entered without issue
- complete the user journey using voice only
