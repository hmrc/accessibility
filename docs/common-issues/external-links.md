# Issue: External links [draft]

External links should contain text informing the user that they will be taken to a new browser tab. 

This will help assistive technology users understand the result of the action and help prevent them possibly getting disorientated when the browser back button is unavailable.

This is not a WCAG fail, but consistant navigation does benefit all users and may prevent disorientation and frustration for some.

## To resolve:

Follow the [external links pattern](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/typography/#external-links) to make it clear clear in the link text that it will open in a new window.

Add â€˜opens in new tabâ€™ as part of the visible link which opens in the new tab. The text should be part of the link to make it easily identifiable for all users as well as being announced as part of the link for assistive technology users.
