# Check native page zoom
Native page zoom is where the OS magnifies the display or part of display so a person with lower visual acuity can determine page content. Typically the magnification will mean that the user will move their finger or cursor around the screen to explore the page.

## System set-up

### Windows
Settings > Ease of Access > Magnifier

### Mac OS
System Preferences > Accessibility > Zoom

Enable the keyboard shortcuts to zoom so you can use Alt + Cmd + 8 to enable / disable zoom

### iOS
Settings > Accessibility > Zoom

### Android
Settings > Accessibility > Magnification > Magnify with triple-tap


## Testing notes
Test pages with x4 (400%) zoom

## What to look for
