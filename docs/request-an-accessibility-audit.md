# Request an accessibility audit

## Before an audit

Before you request an accessibility audit ensure you have implemented recommendations from your private beta RAD review and [tested your service for accessibility](testing-your-service-for-accessibility.md).

## When to get an audit

To meet [public sector accessibility regulations](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps) your service needs to pass an accessibility audit and [publish an accessibility statement](publish-an-accessibility-statement-before-your-service-goes-public.md) before it goes public.

Once you have identified and fixed known accessibility issues, arrange to have an accessibility audit at least 4 weeks before your public beta assessment.

## How to request an audit

Complete an [accessibility audit request form (Word document, 35k)](https://github.com/hmrc/accessibility/blob/master/docs/hmrc-accessibility-audit-request.docx?raw=true).

Youâ€™ll be asked to provide:

- Service name
- About the service
- Project details
- Service contacts
- GitHub details (if applicable)
- Timeline
- Details to access the service (we will need to access each journey up to 12 times so please supply enough credentials to allow this)
- User journeys to be tested

When you have completed the form send your request to <accessibility.team@hmrc.gov.uk> and we will respond within 2 working days.

## How long an audit takes

We will normally carry out a pre-audit check of the service 2 weeks before your audit. This allows us to make sure there are no potential blocking issues which would slow down or prevent the audit. This also allows us to raise any readily identifiable issues to give the service additional time for fixes. A pre-audit check normally takes up to 2 days.

On average  an accessibility audit takes around 5 working days to complete. This depends on the number of pages and user journeys we need to test and the number of accessibility issues we find.

Email <accessibility.team@hmrc.gov.uk> if you have any additional questions, or start a discussion with us on our [GitHub team page](https://github.com/orgs/hmrc/teams/dias).
