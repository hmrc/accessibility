# Issue: Error not associated with input

The error message is present for the form control but it is not programmatically associated with it. 

This means that a screen-reader user who is navigating by form fields, or who moves directly to a field from an error summary link, will not hear the error message.

## To resolve

The error message should have a unique `id` attribute added.

For single inputs the error can be associated adding an `aria-describedby` attribute on the `input` itself, with the error `id` as the value.

For grouped fields where the error refers to all the fields, the `aria-describedby` can be placed on the `fieldset`.

The `aria-describedby` attribute can take multiple `id` references as the value with spaces between.

The order of the `id` in the value will determine the order the content is read out by the screen-reader, so it should be in the same order as the content is on screen - typically the hint first if available, then the error message, but only when present.
