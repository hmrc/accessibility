# Colours

It is important that interfaces do not rely on colour alone.

High contrast and colour filters increases the colour contrast between the foreground and background on your screen, making text and images more distinct and easier to identify.

## System set-up

### Windows

1. From windows search enter `colour filters`: Inverted
2. rom windows search enter `colour filters`: Greyscale
3. From windows search enter `high contrast`: High Contrast Black

### macOS

1. `System Settings > Accessibility > Display > Colour filters > Greyscale`
2. `System Settings > Accessibility > Display > Invert colours > Smart`
3. `System Settings > Accessibility > Display > Display contrast > Drag the slider to at least 50%`

### Android

1. `Settings > Accessibility > Text and display > Colour correction`
2. `Settings > Accessibility > Colour and motion > Colour inversion`

### iOS

1. `Settings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size > Colour filters > Greyscale`
2. `Settings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size > Smart invert`

## Testing notes

1. Enable the `colour filter` to `greyscale` and check the service.
2. Enable the `colour inversion` and check the service.
3. On Windows, enable `high contrast` and check the service.

### What to look for

- check colour contrast hasn't been impeded by the change in colours
- everything is still readable and distinguishable
- focus states are still visible
