# Issue: Link styled as a button [Draft]

For a link styled as a button, add `role="button"` and `data-module="govuk-button"` to initialise the JavaScript polyfill to ensure it acts as a button.

- Adding ARIA `role="button"` will identify the link as a button to assistive technologies.
- Adding `data-module="govuk-button"` makes sure that the link responds to the <kbd>enter</kbd> and <kbd>spacebar</kbd> keypress.

## To resolve

Follow guidance [Using links as buttons](https://github.com/hmrc/accessibility/blob/master/docs/design-and-usability-quick-wins.md#using-links-as-buttons).
