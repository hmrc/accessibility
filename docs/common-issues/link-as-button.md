# Issue: Link styled as a button [Draft]

For link styled as a button add role="button" and initialise the JavaScript polyfill to ensure it acts as a button.
This makes sure that the link responds to spacebar keypress.
Assistive technology will interpret anchor as `button` with the ARIA role "button" and makes it clear that this is a button control and not a link.  User would expect to activate element using `Enter` or `Space` key.

## To resolve
Make sure element uitilising [button.js](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/blob/28ca6d5f61df309c00490f22d809bb6d7aaec7ab/src/components/button/button.js) allowing users to activate it using `space` key.
Follow guidance [Using links as buttons](https://github.com/hmrc/accessibility/blob/master/docs/design-and-usability-quick-wins.md#using-links-as-buttons).
