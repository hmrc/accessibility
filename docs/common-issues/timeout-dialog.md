**Issue:** Missing timeout dialog
**WCAG 2.1 violation:** WCAG 2.2.1
**Description:** The page does not contain the timeout dialog, this is critical in allowing users the time they need to work through a service and complete tasks without losing data.
**Resolve:** Add the timeout dialog to the page. Follow pattern - https://design.tax.service.gov.uk/hmrc-design-patterns/service-timeout/
