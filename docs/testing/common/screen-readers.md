# Testing with a screen-reader
These are tasks to be completed using screen-reader software.

- the content on the page is read by the screen-reader in a logical order (not necessarily the same as visual order)
- moving focus to or from a component or element does not automatically trigger a change
- check all the following are present in the correct dialog list (eg the rotor in Voiceover), for example all buttons are listed in form controls, not in links, and all links, tables and controls have unique names
    - Links
    - Headings
    - Form controls
    - Tables
    - Landmarks
- navigate around the page top to bottom and confirm you do not become trapped in any component
- check tables announce headings correctly as you move around the table from row to row and column to column
- moving direct to an input causes the associated label and any associated hint or error message to be read out
- submitting a page which returns an error summary causes the error summary heading to be read out as soon as the page loads
- error messages are prefixed with ‘error:’
- icons and other images have appropriate accessible names, for example the white exclamation mark on a black circle alongside some important information has an accessible name appropriate to the copy, such as “warning” or “note”
- video media has all information available as screen-reader accessible content for example any information presented in graphics as part of the video are presented in screen-reader accessible captions, audio
- complete the user journey using the screen-reader only
