# Issue: Nested fieldsets [draft]

It is possible to nest a fieldset inside another fieldset. Although it is valid markup, screen readers do not automatically indicate the end of a fieldset which can make if difficult for users to confidently know which fields belong to which fieldset.

This could be a possible blocker for screen-reader users.

## To resolve:

Structure the questions on the page in such a way that nested is not required, if the page is complex then consider spilting the page into multiple smaller, less complex, pages.
