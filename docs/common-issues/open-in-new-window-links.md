# Issue:  Missing â€˜opens in new tabâ€™ as part of the link [draft]

Links that open in a new tab should contain text informing the user that they will be taken to a new browser tab.

This will help all users understand the result of the action and help prevent them possibly getting disorientated when the browser back button is unresponsive.

## To resolve:

Follow the [opening links in a new tab guidance](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/typography/#opening-links-in-a-new-tab).

Add â€˜opens in new tabâ€™ as part of the visible link to make it clear for all users as well as being announced as part of the link for assistive technology users.
