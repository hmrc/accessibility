# Issue: Text is clipped [Draft]

Text is present which does not wrap to stay within the bounds of its parent container when user rely on text resizing. Increasing font size causing the text to either extend beyond the container, causing the layout to break or scrollbars to appear, or the text is clipped by the parent container and content is lost.
This create difficulties for people who rely on text to be resized without loss of the content.
