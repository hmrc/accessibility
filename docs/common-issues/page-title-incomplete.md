# Issue: Page title incomplete

The page title should include specific parts to ensure the user knows which page they are on and which service. As the page title is the first thing a screen-reader user hears when a page loads it is important it is correct and doesn't add any confusion.

## To resolve

Follow the [guidance](https://design.tax.service.gov.uk/hmrc-design-patterns/page-title/).

- Ensure the first part of the page title is representative of the page contents.
- Check the service name is present and that it matches the service name presented in the page header.
- Check the page title ends with "GOV.UK"
