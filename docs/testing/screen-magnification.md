# Use screen magnification

Screen magnification is zooming part of the display so a person with lower visual acuity can determine page content.

Typically the magnification will mean that the user will move their finger or cursor around the screen to explore the page.

## System set-up

### Windows

`Settings > Ease of Access > Magnifier`

### macOS

`System Settings > Accessibility > Zoom`

### Android

`Settings > Accessibility > Magnification`

### iOS

`Settings > Accessibility > Zoom`

## Testing notes

Test pages with `x4` (400%) zoom

### What to look for

- content is readable and cannot be missed
- where pages change layout (for example where most pages donâ€™t use a sidebar, but the odd one does as this suggests a learned pattern which is then broken)
- pages which have related content remote from each other without any indicator to tie them together (for example a Check Your Answer page is missing the line under each row)
- hover states which cover information or which contain information that cannot be read in full without moving off the trigger area
