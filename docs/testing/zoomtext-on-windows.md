# ZoomText on Windows
ZoomText is a commercial screen magnifier with a basic screen-reader built in.

A trial version is available.

Fully licensed installs are available to use on the HMRC accessibility lab laptops.

## System set-up
Install the latest version of ZoomText.

Use the default settings. ZoomText has a lot of options and it is best to leave the defaults to ensure ease of replication of any issue.

## Testing notes
Use with Chrome, Firefox or IE11.

Increase magnification to 4x zoom

Note - performs better with Firefox when using the text-to-voice reader (for example, with AF style radios, the voice does not read out labels in Chrome, but does in Firefox).

## What to look for
Perform the [common screen magnification tests](common/screen-magnification.md)
