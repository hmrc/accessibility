# Missing instructions

Where there is a requirement for data to be entered in a particular way, the user needs to be informed of this up front.

If a user is only told of a format requirement in the error message, then it is being communicated too late - going back to review an error, process it, understand how it relates to the entered data and then editing the entered data is a lot of additional work.

## To resolve

Follow the [text input guidance on hint copy](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/text-input/#hint-text). Ensure the hint copy is correctly associated with the form controls using aria so screen-reader users are aware of it.

Hint copy should be short and only help the user with how they should enter data in the form. General guidance should precede the form.
