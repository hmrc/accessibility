# Issue: Timeout dialog - cannot extend session

While the service has a timeout dialog and it is presented correctly, the user's session is being lost.

This can be for a number of reasons:

- the endpoint is not triggering a renewed session either in the frontend or in the database
- the service is timing out due to the user being passed temporarily to another service where the user spends longer than the originator service's timeout period

Being able to extend a session is critical in allowing users the time they need to work through a service and complete tasks without losing data.

People with disabilities such as blindness, low vision, dexterity impairments or cognitive impairments may require more time to read content or to complete a task like filling in a form.

## To resolve

- ensure the endpoint for the "stay signed in" option is truly refreshing the user's session
- where a second service is being passed to, this can be partially remediated by targeting both service's endpoints from the second service's timeout dialog. Other techniques may be necessary for where timeout's are being caused due to time spent on the second service before being passed to the first.

| ðŸ”´ (H) | A    | [#issue](): Session timing out | 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable |

## Statement

### Accessibility problems

```
the dialog allowing users to extend the time allowed to complete any particular page is not working / users are not being warned before being logged out when their session ends
```

### Milestones

```
a timeout occurs without the ability for the user to extend their session. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.2.1 (Timing Adjustable)
```
