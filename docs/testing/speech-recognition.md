## What to look for

- check all links, buttons and inputs can be accessed directly. Where possible this should be done via a unique name. Where this is not possible (for example a check your answers page with multiple 'change' links) saying the visible name should provide the user with numbered options to select from. Using the grid overlay should be a last resort and if required will need additional investigation.
- check all inputs can be entered without issue
