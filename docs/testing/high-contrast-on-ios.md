# High contrast on iOS

## System set-up
Settings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size
These are the settings we will be testing with:
- Increase Contrast
- Smart Invert
- Classic Invert

## Testing notes
Enable each of the settings individually, remembering to disable the current one before starting the next.

## What to look for
Check colour contrast hasn't been impeded by the change in colours and that everything is still readable
