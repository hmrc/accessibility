# Request an accessibility audit

## Before an audit

Before you request an accessibility audit ensure you have implemented recommendations from your  private beta RAD review and [checked the accessibility of your service](check-your-services-accessibility-before-you-get-an-audit.md).

## When to get an audit

To meet [public sector accessibility regulations](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps) your service needs to pass an accessibility audit and [publish an accessibility statement](publish-an-accessibility-statement-before-your-service-goes-public.md) before it goes public.

Once you have identified and fixed known accessibility issues, arrange to have an accessibility audit at least 4 weeks before your public beta assessment.

## How to request an audit

Complete an accessibility audit request form.

Youâ€™ll be asked to provide:

- Service name
- Service contact
- Description of the service
- When the service is due to go into public beta
- Details to access the service
- User journeys that need testing

When you have completed the form send your request to <accessibility.team@hmrc.gov.uk> and we will respond within 2 working days.

## How long an audit takes

This depends on the size of the service and the number of errors we discover for inclusion in your accessibility report.

We aim to conduct a full WCAG 2.1 AA technical accessibility audit and test with [commonly used assistive technology](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/testing-with-assistive-technologies) within 5 working days. The fewer issues your service has, the quicker we can produce a report.

Email <accessibility.team@hmrc.gov.uk> if you have any additional questions, or start a discussion with us on our [GitHub team page](https://github.com/orgs/hmrc/teams/disc).
