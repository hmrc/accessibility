# Issue: No timeout dialog [draft]

The page does not contain the timeout dialog, this is critical in allowing users the time they need to work through a service and complete tasks without losing data.

People with disabilities such as blindness, low vision, dexterity impairments or cognitive limitations may require more time to read content or to complete a task like filling in a form. 

## To resolve:

Implement the service timeout, follow the [service timeout pattern](https://design.tax.service.gov.uk/hmrc-design-patterns/service-timeout/).
