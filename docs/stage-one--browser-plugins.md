# Stage one: browser plugins

These are tools that any member of the team can use at their desk while they’re testing the service.

While there are many plugins listed here, you don’t have to use all of them. With the exception of Toggle JavaScript, they do a lot of the same things but there is some overlap. Take them all for a spin, see which ones you prefer.
