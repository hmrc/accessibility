# Issue: Missing inputmode

Inputmodes are a useful hint for browsers to present the correct virtual keyboard for the required data. For example when asking for a number the device can use the inputmode to present a numeric keyboard.

Using this attribute saves the user addtional keystrokes which can be very helpful if the user has dexterity issues for example.

## To resolve

Typically the primary `inputmode` which will be used is `inputmode="numeric"` (along with `pattern="[0-9]*"` for legacy support). This should be used when asking for whole numbers only, such as dates.

Note, when adding a `pattern` attribute, this will trigger HTML5 form validation due to intrinsic constraints. As this is not desirable behaviour, to stop this from happening you should add a `novalidate` attribute to the `form` element.

Due to poor support in certain browsers, `inputmode="decimal"` should not be used, despite it being a good fit for currency fields. Using it could prevent a user from entering the correct information, so a plain `type="text"` field with no `inputmode` should be used.

The following should use the specific `type` attributes rather than the matching `inputmode` as these will have better support:
- email - use `type="email"`
- phone - use `type="tel"`

## Labels
- text input
- date input
- telephone numbers
- email addresses
