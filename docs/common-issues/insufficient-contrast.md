# Issue: Insufficient contrast (legacy styles)

With the arrival of WCAG 2.1 many of the colour palette and focus styles used in the design systems needed to be updated to be compliant.

Low colour contrast can affect users with various vision related conditions and can cause unnessessry eye strain when using the service.

If your service is using an old version of a library (eg pre Assets Frontend 3.14.0) then you should look at updating to the latest version as soon as possible.

The legacy styles affected include:
- link focus state
- input focus state
- input error state
- input error focus state

There is a [blog post](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2019/07/29/weve-made-the-gov-uk-design-system-more-accessible/) which summarises what the old vs new styles look like.

## To resolve

Either:
- update Assets Frontend to the latest version (note, if you were using the [patch code](https://gist.github.com/adamliptrot-oc/f77250a6f69fb31fabd935e2002f4964) for earlier versions of Assets Frontend, you should remove this as this was incorporated into AF 3.14.0)
- migrate your service to Gov Frontend / HMRC Frontend
