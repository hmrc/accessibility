# Accessibility Statement template: non-compliant

## Scenario: service has undergone no accessibility testing

These are the areas of the accessibility statement you need to provide content for.

It does not contain any of the ‘legal text’. This is built into the accessibility statement service. You will only see all the wording together when the statement is built and ready for checking and is ready to publish.

### Service name

### Service URL

[This will be body text and not a hyperlink in the statement.

Support text: This will generally be the URL you target for the ‘Start now’ button on a start page. Sometimes this is also the page that service teams put into the ‘redirect url’ box in auth stub when you are testing.]
