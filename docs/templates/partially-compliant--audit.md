# Accessibility Statement template: partially compliant - automated tools

## Scenario: service has tested with automated tools

These are the areas of the accessibility statement you need to provide content for.

It does not contain any of the ‘legal text’. This is built into the accessibility statement service. You will only see all the wording together when the statement is built and ready for checking and is ready to publish.

## Content areas for your statement

### Service name

### Service URL

[This will be body text and not a hyperlink in the statement.

Support text: This will generally be the URL you target for the ‘Start now’  button on a start page. Sometimes this is also the page that service teams put into the ‘redirect url’ box in auth stub when you are testing.]

### Using this service

[This is the heading on the actual statement.

Accessibility statement service frontend field: `serviceDescription`]

[Support text: in this section insert a brief summary about what your service does. Sentences only. No bullets or numbers etc.]

### How accessible is this service

[This is the heading on the actual statement.

Accessibility statement service frontend field: `accessibility problems`]

Service compliance status: partial for this scenario

[Accessibility statement service frontend field: `complianceStatus`]

[Support text: use this section to Highlight anything that might cause disabled users a significant problem, whether or not it meets WCAG 2.1 AA standard. Include any usability issues that give users information they can act on; such as workarounds. Especially if it will reduce contact.

Use the list of WCAG failures from your automated tool testing report as your starting point. This section needs to give the user a plain english overview of the issues that may affect their interaction with the service. The section &#39;Technical information about this service&#39;s accessibility&#39; will contain the technical detail of the WCAG failures]

Try to list in order of most impact to least impact. For example:

Some people may find parts of this service difficult to use:

- at one point we display location information on a map - however, there&#39;s also a postcode lookup tool that&#39;s accessible to visually impaired users using assistive technology
- we may ask you to physically sign a document we send to you - however, there&#39;s also an option that lets you confirm your agreement over the phone
- there&#39;s an instructional video inside the service that doesn&#39;t have captions (it&#39;s an old video, and we&#39;ll add captions when we re-shoot it)]
- you cannot skip to the main content when using a screen reader
- some of our online forms are difficult to navigate using just a keyboard
- you cannot modify the line height or spacing of text

#### Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations

[These are the headings from the statement.

Accessibility statement service frontend field: `milestones`

Dates must be shown as: YYYY/MM/DD]

[Support text: this subsection covers any technical issues that cause a problem with the user’s journey. This information is from the automated tool testing report. You will need to rewrite them into plain English.

List:

- accessibility problems
- which of the WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria the problem fails on
- when you plan to fix the problem

For example: This is how accessibility issues will appear once the statement is created.

The service uses diagrams to show users how to take a photograph of themselves so they can create an identification document. There is not a text alternative for some of these diagrams, so information in them isn’t available to people using a screen reader. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content). This will be fixed by 30 September 2020 by adding text alternatives to all diagrams.]

Milestones:

[Support text: add as many description and date lines as you need.]

description : `milestone description`.

date: [YYYY/MM/DD]
